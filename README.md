# AHI-Capstone-Project

This project involves analyzing the trends in mortality rates due to stroke and heart disease change from 2000 to 2019. This analysis will include the patterns in geographic, race, gender, and age disparities to study if a specific group of individuals may be more likely or not to develop stroke and heart disease based on where they live, their race, their gender, and their age. 

# Objective
Be able to make a predictive model based on past trends to forecast future heart disease and stroke mortality rates by determining which population will have a higher risk.
